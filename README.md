# 🚀 NextPath – Graph Algorithm Visualizer

**NextPath** is an interactive, beautifully animated **graph algorithm visualizer** built with **Next.js**, **React Flow**, and **Tailwind CSS**. Designed as a learning + portfolio project, it helps visualize complex graph traversal algorithms step by step.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Single Page Application** (SPA) using Next.js 14 (App Router)
- 🎨 **Dark / Light Mode** toggle
- ⏯️ **Play / Pause / Next Step** traversal controls
- ⚡ **Speed Slider** to control animation pace
- 📊 **Grid-based** and **Graph-node-based** visualization styles
- 🧠 Supports algorithms like **BFS**, **DFS**, and **Dijkstra** (more coming!)
- 💾 **Save / Export** graph configuration
- ⚙️ Left panel for **settings**, right for interactive **workspace**

Let me know once you have a logo or screenshot — I can update the preview section too. Want me to create a simple **logo** for NextPath as well?
